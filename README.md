# üç¨ SweetCrypt Glycan Encryptor

**Project for 418 Hackathon hosted by Enigma under AEON 2025**

A unique encryption tool that combines strong cryptography with glycan-inspired visualization, created for the 418 Hackathon.

## Features

- AES-256-GCM encryption with scrypt key derivation
- Glycan-inspired symbol visualization of encrypted data
- File and text encryption support
- Streamlit web interface

üöÄ Why SweetCrypt Outperforms Traditional Encoding
Technical Advantages
Glycan-Inspired Visualization

Unlike base64/hex which produce garbled strings, SweetCrypt generates memorable, shareable symbols (e.g., ABC123üç¨) while maintaining AES-256-GCM security.

Perfect for human verification of encrypted chunks without exposing sensitive data.

Position-Aware Integrity

Each symbol embeds a BLAKE2b hash of its position + content, detecting tampering or reordering attacks that traditional methods miss.

Multi-Format Ready

Handles text, PDFs, and images seamlessly, while most encoders (like PGP) require format-specific tools.

Zero Metadata Leaks

Traditional methods leak metadata in headers. SweetCrypt‚Äôs salt/IV/tag separation minimizes exposure.
